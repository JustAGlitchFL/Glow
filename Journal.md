## 5/28/2025: Ideation and planning
3 hours

I first got the idea for this project from a fusion of planning my dorm room for college, and buying a Fujifilm X-M5 for photography and videography. Lighting is a crucial part of getting a good image. Additionally, I also wanted a very functional and repositionable desk lamp for working on projects. The combination of wanting decent lighting for filming myself at my desk, decent lighting for projects, battery powered accent lighting for interesting photos and videos, and space saving led me to combine all of these. The general concept of this is a diffused panel of LEDs with both adjustable temperature white and full RGB control. It will be powered either through battery of USB-C for portability, and be mounted on a quarter/20 thread to use various mounts, and fit into a standard shoe to use on camera. These lights will be connected wirelessly, so settings can be changed on one light and linked to the others. Connecting a panel to the camera's hot shoe allows it to be used as a flash, and to trigger the other panels at the same time. The thread can also be used to mount it to an IKEA LÃ…NESPELARE arm, turning it into a repositionable desk lamp, or a key light for desk filming (I also plan to put the X-M5 on another as a versatile desk mount, while my existing microphone currently sits supported by a similar arm as I write this.)
